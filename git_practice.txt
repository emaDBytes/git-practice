When several people are working on the same project, it is not uncommon for two developers to make changes to the same lines in some file. When merging the two changes together, how does Git know which of the changes to discard and which one to keep? Well, it doesnâ€™t, and so when mutually exclusive changes are found when merging, the automatic merge will fail. The conflict between two commits (or branches) is called a merge conflict. In these cases, someone has to hand pick the changes which will be kept in the project. This is called resolving a merge conflict.
